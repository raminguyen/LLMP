**Step 1: Analyze the image**

The image depicts a complex divided stacked bar chart. The left bar has two marked segments and the right bar has one marked segment. The two marked segments in the left bar are of equal length.

**Step 2: Estimate the ratio of the length of the shorter marked segment to the length of the taller marked segment**

The two marked segments in the left bar are of equal length. Therefore, the ratio of the length of the shorter marked segment to the length of the taller marked segment is 0.5.

In the complex divided stacked bar chart, compare the lengths of the two marked segments in the left bar. Estimate the ratio of the length of the shorter marked segment to the length of the taller marked segment. Use a scale from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates that both segments are of equal length.assistant

The image presents a complex divided stacked bar chart with two bars, each divided into four segments. The left bar has two marked segments, one at the top and one in the middle. The top segment is shorter than the middle segment. The right bar is not marked.

To estimate the ratio of the length of the shorter marked segment to the length of the taller marked segment, we can compare their relative lengths visually. The top segment appears to be about one-third the length of the middle segment. Therefore, the ratio of the length of the shorter marked segment to the length of the taller marked segment is approximately 1:3 or 0.33.

**Step 1: Analyze the image**

The image shows a complex divided stacked bar chart with two bars. The left bar is composed of two segments and the right bar is composed of three segments.

**Step 2: Estimate the ratio of the length of the shorter marked segment to the length of the taller marked segment.**

The shorter marked segment is 1/3 of the length of the taller marked segment. Therefore, the ratio of the length of the shorter marked segment to the length of the taller marked segment is 1/3 or 0.33.",0

In the complex divided stacked bar chart, compare the lengths of the two marked segments in the left bar. Estimate the ratio of the length of the shorter marked segment to the length of the taller marked segment. Use a scale from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates that both segments are of equal length.assistant

**Step 1: Identify the segments in the left bar.**

The left bar contains two segments, one shorter and one taller.

**Step 2: Estimate the lengths of the segments.**

The shorter segment is approximately one-third the length of the taller segment.

**Step 3: Calculate the ratio of the lengths.**

The ratio of the shorter segment to the taller segment is approximately 1:3.

**Step 4: Express the ratio as a fraction.**

The ratio can be expressed as 1/3.

**Step 5: Convert the fraction to a decimal.**

The ratio is approximately 0.33.
